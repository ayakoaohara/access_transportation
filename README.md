# transportationForEveryone
transportationForEveryone is an accessibility iOS application for navigating public transportation in New York City. It is designed to assist users who have difficulty in walking. The purpose of this project is to help people with disabilities with navigating through the city and make public transportation more inclusive and efficient for everyone.

## What and Why?
Public transportation in New York City, especially the subway system, is not wheel chair friendly. As a result, the transportation system excludes many people from using it. I believe that creating an application for people who uses a wheel chair or a set of cruches will facilitate their daily acitivties and make the transportation system more inclusive.

## For whom?
This application is designed for people who have difficulty in walking (people who uses wheel chair, people who uses cruches, and others who cannot use the stairs).

## How?
Given a distination, the application gives the user a list of travel routes, sorted by price and time. In addition, a graphic representation of each travel route will be shown in a map.

## Scope
For a semester project to be completed by 4-5 people, this project is sufficiently complex. It requires fetching information from different websites, creating a UI with a map page, and writing an algorithm that calculates the most efficient travel routes. However, the project is not too difficult to complete, since many pieces of information required for this application is available on the internet.
